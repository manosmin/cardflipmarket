# CardFlipMarket

CardFlipMarket is a website that shows the most recent card price spikes for [MTGO](https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo) cards. MTGO is a video game adaptation of [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en), utilizing the concept of a virtual economy, in order to preserve the collectible aspect of the card game. 

The users can choose between different time ranges for card price changes, and can also see a line chart of the card price history for each of the cards that have spiked. Card price data is automatically refreshed every day using the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api), to provide the most up-to-date card prices available. 

This website makes it easier for users to see the card prices spikes in the virtual world of Magic: The Gathering, in order to be able to predict corresponding card price spikes in the real world as well.
